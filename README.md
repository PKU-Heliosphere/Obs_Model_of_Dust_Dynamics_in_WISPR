# Obs_Model_of_Dust_Dynamics_in_WISPR
The goal of this repository is to study the dynamics of dust particles in the inner heliosphere from two aspects.
One aspect is to investigate the direction, position, size, and speed of the dust particles from the traces observed from WISPR imager onboard PSP (i.e., approach of inversion).
The other aspect is to forward model the traces of dust particles as captured by virtual WISPR imager under the condition of preset dust particle's position, size, and velocity.
